[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

A modern desktop application built by **Hamoon Soleimani** to consolidate any code project into a single, structured text file. This output is perfectly formatted for large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini, allowing you to give the AI a comprehensive view of your entire codebase for advanced debugging, analysis, and refactoring.

### The Problem It Solves

When working with AI models, providing context is key. Pasting individual files is tedious and often misses the "big picture"â€”dependencies in `build.gradle`, settings in `AndroidManifest.xml`, or connections between different classes. This tool automates the process, creating a complete, single-file context that gives the AI everything it needs to understand your project's architecture.

### Key Features

- **Modern & Intuitive UI:** Built with `customtkinter` for a beautiful, themeable interface that works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Interactive File Selection:** Easily browse for your project directory and choose where to save the consolidated output file.
- **Fully Customizable Rules:** Interactively edit lists of file extensions to include and directories/files to exclude, tailoring the output to your exact needs.
- **Non-Blocking Operation:** The heavy lifting is done in a background thread, ensuring the application UI never freezes, even with large projects.
- **Real-time Progress:** A dynamic progress bar and status label show you exactly which file is being processed.
- **Detailed Summary Report:** After processing, get a full report including files processed, total lines of code, and final output size.
- **Convenient Post-Actions:**
  - **Copy to Clipboard:** Instantly copy the entire generated text with a single click.
  - **Open File:** Immediately open the generated `.txt` file in your default text editor.
